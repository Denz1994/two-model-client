# Overview
This is the client interface of a 3 part microservice to report user data. There are some basic operations that fetch data and display relevant information in a table.

# Usage

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Clone https://github.com/Denz1994/two-model-server locally
3. run `npm start` for BOTH the client and server

At this point you should be able to enter queries into the form on the interface and submit. A table will display with fetched data.
Note: Confirm that the server is running locally as it will fetch data via API endpoints

### Please open a github issue with any issues uncovered.
This is an project undergoing continued development.
